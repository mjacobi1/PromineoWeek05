package week5;


	//////Create an interface named Logger.
	//////Add two void methods to the Logger interface, each should take a String as an argument
	//////Log
	/////Error
	//////Create two classes that implement the Logger interface
	//////AsteriskLogger
	//////SpacedLogger
	//////The log method on the AsteriskLogger should print out the String it receives between 
	//////3 asterisks on either side of the String (e.g. if the String passed in is “Hello”, then 
	//////it should print ***Hello*** to the console).
	//////The error method on the AsteriskLogger should print the String it receives inside a box 
	//////of asterisks, with the String preceded by the word “ERROR:”. For example, if “Hello” is 
	//////the argument, the following should be printed:
	//////
	//////****************
	//////***Error: Hello***
	//////****************
	//The SpacedLogger should add spaces between each character of the String argument passed 
	//into its methods.
	//If the log method received “Hello” as an argument, it should print H e l l o
	//The error method should do the same, but with “ERROR:” preceding the spaced out input 
	//(i.e. ERROR: H e l l o)
	//Create a class named App that has a main method.
	//In this class instantiate an instance of each of your logger classes that implement the 
	//Logger interface.
	//Test both methods on both instances, passing in Strings of your choice.
